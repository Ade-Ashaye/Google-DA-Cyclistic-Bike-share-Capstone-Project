# Google-DA-Cyclistic-Bike-Share-Capstone-Project
This is the capstone project done at the end of the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate.
## Case Study: How Does a Bike-Share Navigate Speedy Success?
### Introduction
Welcome to the Cyclistic bike-share analysis case study! In this case study, I will perform many real-world tasks of a junior data analyst. I will work for a fictional company, *Cyclistic* and meet different characters and team members. In order to answer the key business questions, I will follow the steps of the data analysis process: ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act.
### Scenario
I am a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the company's future success depends of maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, my team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, my team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders to annual members.
### About the company
In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown into a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime.
Until now, Cyclistic's marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appaling to broad consumer segments. One approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibilty of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.
Cyclistic's finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. Although the pricing flexibility helps Cyclistic attract more customers, the director of marketing, Lily Moreno believes that maximizing the number of annual members will be key to future growth. Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers, Moreno believes there is a very good chance to convert casual riders into members. She notes that casual riders are already aware of the Cyclistic program and have chosen Cyclistic for their mobility needs.
Moreno has set a clear goal: Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. In order to do that, however, the marketing analyst team needs to better understand how annual members and casual riders differ, why casual riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could affect their marketing tactics. Moreno and her team are interested in analyzing the Cyclistic historical bike trip data to identify trends.
## Phase One: Ask
Three questions will guide the future marketing program: 1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently? 2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships? 3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members? 
## Phase Two: Prepare 
The data that we will be using is Cyclistic’s historical trip data from last 12 months (January-2022 to December-2022). The data has been made available by Motivate International Inc.

The dataset consists of 12 CSV files (each for a month) with 13 columns and more than 4 million rows.

ROCCC approach is used to determine the credibility of the data

Reliable – It is complete and accurate and it represents all bike rides taken in the city of Chicago for the selected duration of our analysis.
Original - The data is made available by Motivate International Inc. which operates the city of Chicago’s Divvy bicycle sharing service which is powered by Lyft.
